  ( This extensions is part of the `extensionsX.qky` file included
    in the Quackery repository. It's purpose is to replace the base
    sorting words that use insertion sort with a more efficient
    algorithm.
    
    # Glossary:
    
    merge.test ( --> s ):
      An ancillary stack used by the merging words.
    
    mergewith ( [ [ --> [ ):
      takes two sorted nests and merges them using the item following
      `mergewith`, which should take two items for comparison and
      return a boolean.
    
    sort.test, sortwith, sort, sort$:
      Changed to use merge sort for nests bigger than 16 items.      )
